## Overview

ZA Racing is a fully playable top-down arcade car racing game that runs entirely in the browser — no backend, no downloads, no dependencies beyond the browser itself.

Built to demonstrate real frontend engineering depth: a 60fps game loop, AABB collision detection, a scoring system, engine and crash sound effects, and a polished responsive UI — all structured with modern Next.js App Router and TypeScript.

---

## Why This Project Stands Out

Most portfolio projects are CRUD apps or static landing pages. ZA Racing is different:

| Capability | What It Demonstrates |
|---|---|
| 60fps game loop | `requestAnimationFrame` with ref-based state to avoid stale closures |
| Collision detection | AABB algorithm with 6px forgiveness padding |
| Sound system | HTML5 Audio triggered correctly from user gesture context |
| Score + high score | Session-persistent across runs without a database |
| Dynamic difficulty | Speed scales every frame; spawn interval tightens over time |
| Responsive canvas | Drawing buffer fixed at 480×720; CSS scales display to any screen |
| Premium UI | Glassmorphism HUD, animated hero preview, neon glow system |
| Clean architecture | Game loop, renderer, and collision each isolated in their own module |

---

## Features

- **Playable racing game** — fully interactive, not a demo
- **Smooth lane controls** — Arrow keys or A / D, immediate response
- **Dynamic difficulty** — speed and spawn rate increase as you survive
- **Live score** — increments every frame while running
- **Session high score** — persists across restarts without storage
- **Engine sound** — loops while running, triggered directly from click gesture
- **Crash sound** — fires once on collision, then game over
- **Glassmorphism HUD** — score, speed multiplier, best score in a blur-backed strip
- **Game over modal** — animated, shows score, best, new record badge
- **Premium dark UI** — red/purple neon accent system throughout
- **Fully responsive** — canvas scales cleanly on mobile without distortion

## Tech Stack

| Technology | Usage |
|---|---|
| **Next.js 16** | App Router, static pre-rendering, file-based routing |
| **TypeScript** | Full type coverage across game logic and UI |
| **Tailwind CSS v4** | Utility styling; pure CSS for custom button classes |
| **HTML5 Canvas** | All game rendering — road, cars, explosion, lane lines |
| **React Hooks** | `useRef` for 60fps state, `useState` for display values |
| **requestAnimationFrame** | Game loop with timestamp-based logic |
| **HTML5 Audio API** | Engine loop + crash one-shot, user-gesture safe |

## Gameplay Flow

```
Player clicks "Start Engine"
  → engine.mp3 begins looping
  → game loop starts (requestAnimationFrame)
  → enemy cars spawn at increasing intervals
  → road lines scroll downward at current speed
  → score increments every frame
  → speed increases every frame

Player hits an enemy car
  → collision detected (AABB)
  → engine.mp3 stops
  → crash.mp3 fires once
  → explosion renders at collision point
  → game over modal appears with final score

Player clicks "Race Again"
  → state resets cleanly
  → engine.mp3 starts again from click gesture
  → new run begins
```

## Available Routes

| Route | Description |
|---|---|
| `/` | Homepage — project overview, features, tech stack, CTA |
| `/game` | Playable game — full canvas racing experience |

Both routes are statically pre-rendered — no server runtime required.

## Future Improvements

- [ ] Mobile touch controls (swipe left / right)
- [ ] Global leaderboard (Supabase or PlanetScale)
- [ ] Background music with toggle
- [ ] Multiple difficulty modes (Easy / Normal / Insane)
- [ ] Power-ups (shield, slow time)
- [ ] SVG branding pack and custom car skins
- [ ] Share score to Twitter / X
